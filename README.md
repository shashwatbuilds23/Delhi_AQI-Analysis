# Delhi_AQI-Analysis
# 🌆 Delhi Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis and Prediction

This project analyzes and visualizes Delhi's air quality data to understand pollution patterns and predict AQI levels using exploratory data analysis (EDA).
It leverages Python data science libraries for data cleaning, feature analysis, and visual storytelling to uncover insights into Delhi’s air pollution trends.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze real-world AQI data of Delhi.
- Explore relationships between pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, and O₃.
- Visualize trends over time and identify pollution spikes.

This project provides a foundation for understanding urban air quality dynamics.
